# Procedural Area of Effect Shader - by Jorel
Shader for procedural AOE, inspired by Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2 areas of effect. Several settings in the shader that allow you to configure it to dynamically fit the AOEs of your abilities / spells / explosions, without creating meshes on runtime.
Change those settings through code with material.SetColor or material.SetFloat.

## Features:
 - Different Border sizes and colors
 - Complete circle or an arc aiming at a custom direction
 - Filled circle or with a hole inside
 - Differentiate inner color and/or hole color
